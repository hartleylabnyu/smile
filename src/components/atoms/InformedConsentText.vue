                <p>
                    Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained by digitally and physically storing your identifiable information separately from your data. This research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your explicit approval for the researchers to release your name and/or personally identifiable information.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Reward and Punishment Task</h3>

                <p>
                    Since you will be receiving compensation for your involvement in this study, the fact that you participated in an experiment with the Hartley Lab, and the email address used for payment (where applicable), will be shared with New York University financial administrators.
